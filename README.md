# MD Blog Generator made with NodeJS

My objectives:
- Create my own blog using NodeJS ✅
- Learn `fs` commands in NodeJS ✅
- Convert Markdown files to HTML using the `marked` module ✅
- Create an Express server and host it on repl.it ✅
  - https://blog.vincanger.repl.co
- ✌

How the code works:
- Posts are made as individual MD files (see 'content' folder)
- Front-matter within the posts gets parsed
- The `marked` module converts MD to HTML
- and the magic of JavaScript puts it all together 🧙‍♂️
